inside the zoom folder where the script is saved, create folders with name of class you have to take attendance for. example- I had to take attendance for class 9th, 10th, 11th so i created 3 folders named '9', '10', '11'. you can use anything.

# pre-requisites
when you take your class, attendance will be saved inside the zoom folder.
move the chat folder to their respective classes folder.

also you must have a excel sheet of names of students with name "{classname}th".xlsx 



# how to use
open script and run
script will ask for input for your class, give the input and hit enter.
The attendance will be marked automatically.
when you want to take attendance for next day just do the same and the attendance will not overwrite but will be appended.

once attendance is done, move all the chat files to done folder so that they wont be marked again.
